    title1: 'What is Fine'
    quote1: 'Fine is a tool to help you generate document sites from individual documents without a server required on your part. It is fast, safe and easy to use, plus you don’t have to worry about neither style nor implementation at all. '
    quote2: 'You can even use Fine to start your own blog, as it provides customized domains to each site it generates.'

    usage3: 'That’s it?'
